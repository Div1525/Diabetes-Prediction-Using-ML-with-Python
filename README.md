1. Data Collection and Overview
   - We used the **PIMA Diabetes dataset**, which contains health-related information on individuals (768 rows with 8 features), including **Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction**, and **Age**.
   - The **Outcome column** is our target variable, with values **0** (non-diabetic) and **1** (diabetic). This is a binary classification problem, where we aim to predict whether a person has diabetes.

2. Data Exploration and Analysis
   - We examined the data distribution and summary statistics to understand the central tendencies and variability of each feature.
   - The dataset was analyzed by grouping by **Outcome** to see differences in mean values between diabetic and non-diabetic groups.
   - This revealed useful patterns, such as higher average glucose levels and BMI among diabetic individuals, which are key indicators of diabetes.

3. Data Preprocessing and Standardization
   - To ensure each feature contributed equally to the model, we applied StandardScaler to normalize the data. This scaled each feature to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, making the data suitable for algorithms sensitive to feature scale, like Support Vector Machines (SVM).

4. Feature and Label Separation
   - We separated the data into features (X) and labels (Y), where X represents health measurements and Y represents the diabetes outcome.

5. Train-Test Split
   - We split the dataset into **training (80%) and test (20%) subsets**, using `train_test_split`. This approach allows us to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

6. Model Training
   - We trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel using the training data. SVM is well-suited for binary classification tasks, and the linear kernel provides a clear separation boundary between classes.

7. Model Evaluation
   - We calculated accuracy scores on both the training and test sets to assess model performance. The accuracy was around **78.7% on training data** and **77.3% on test data**, indicating that the model generalized fairly well to unseen data.

8. Making a Predictive System
   - A function was developed to make predictions based on user input. The input data is first converted to a NumPy array and then reshaped to match the modelâ€™s expected input format.
   - The data is **standardized** before being fed to the classifier for prediction. Based on the output, the system determines if a person is likely diabetic. 
   - 9. Example Prediction
   - For example, given input data `(5, 166, 72, 19, 175, 25.8, 0.587, 51)`, the model predicts a **diabetic outcome** (output: `1`).

This system could potentially support early diabetes detection, allowing healthcare providers to take preventative measures. The project demonstrates skills in **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation**, as well as the ability to create a **real-world predictive system**.
